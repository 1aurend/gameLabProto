But qua mechanic, time includes clock time and the various ways in which we can segment and “control” it—i.e. by instituting “pause” or “rewind” mechanisms; races, whether against the clock or another student or the instructor or one’s past self; and “turns” where a meaningful unit of time consists not of some measure of minutes but a unit of action. In addition, we can take the calendar rather than clock perspective on time.

    pitch: "Mechanics are the interactions and relationships that make a game a system. Mechanics are what make a game interactive rather than entertainment you just take in. Put simply, mechanics are what make a game work. For this reason, designing with mechanics in mind is the key way teachers can apply the logic of game design to the classroom.",
    what: "Well, tomes have been written in literal answer to this question. But qua mechanic, time includes clock time and the various ways in which we can segment and “control” it—i.e. by instituting “pause” or “rewind” mechanisms; races, whether against the clock or another student or the instructor or one’s past self; and “turns” where a meaningful unit of time consists not of some measure of minutes but a unit of action. In addition, we can take the calendar rather than clock perspective on time. At the course or syllabus level, units and assignments are allotted quantities of calendar time; students are given more or less control over when/how they allocate time to the course; course rhythms are established or broken.",

From setting stakes and expectations to including more voices in a conversation, there are many reasons to not lose track of time.",

    pitch: "Multiplayer is one of the easiest mechanics to use. Every classroom is inherently set up to be multiplayer: you have many people working on the same task, all trying to achieve the same thing. Moreover, multiplayer experiences encourage peer-peer learning, teamwork skills, negotiation and strategy, and allow students to create substantial volumes of work in a short period of time. Multiplayer as a game design mechanic, though, recognises that employing multiple people in the same task changes the experiences and strategies of the individual player enormously and can often change the outcomes.",

  subtitle: `Welcome to gameLab! The Learning Lab’s handbook on game design for teachers.`,
  pitch: `So why game design? Well, have you ever been disappointed by a class you were really excited about? It probably wasn’t the course content that bored you; it more likely had something to do with how your experience as a student was crafted: Were the assignments too hard or too easy? Were there not enough different ways to engage the material? Did the physical space of the classroom not fit the activities the class engaged in? If these are the sorts of things that make or break the student experience, then we as teachers should look to others who spend a lot of time thinking about and crafting experiences, and game designers seem to be the people doing this most successfully. The video game industry has outgrown all other forms of entertainment in terms of market share. The power of a game design perspective is that it puts the user experience at the center. This is hugely powerful in increasing motivation and engagement.`,
  close: `This website provides tools for applying the logic of games to the classroom, not to turn the classroom into a game, but so that we can be intentional about centering experience in our instructional design.`

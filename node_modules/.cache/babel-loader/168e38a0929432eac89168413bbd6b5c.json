While, of course, we can’t actually pause or rewind time, we can institute mechanisms by which we or our students can hit “pause” or “rewind” on a discussion. Pauses can be used for writing or quiet reflection; calling for a rewind might mean spending more time on a difficult concept. However you structure them, these “buttons” and the pursuant breaks in the flow of a lecture or discussion can be powerful signals about what’s valued in a class.',\r\n          effects:\r\n          [\r\n            {\r\n              what: 'Make space to cool off or reflect',\r\n              how:\r\n              [\r\n                'Hit pause to reflect on what just happened or to make space for silence',\r\n                'Pause for writing or to pair share',\r\n                'Rewind to take more time for a difficult concept or question',\r\n              ]\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              what: 'Create a sense of autonomy',\r\n              how:\r\n              [\r\n                'Allowing students to change the pace or flow of discussion can produce a sense of agency',\r\n                'Fast forward if students already understand how to solve a problem; rewind if they need to go through something more slowly',\r\n              ]\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              what: 'Create checkpoints',\r\n              how:\r\n              [\r\n                'Asking if anyone wants to pause or rewind can be a way to check in about pacing',\r\n              ]\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              what: 'Help students practice presenting',\r\n              how:\r\n              [\r\n                'Pair students up or put them in small groups to practice presenting or explaining course concepts; the group members can use pause-rewind-fast forward to help the presenter pitch their material at the right pace and level of detail for the intended audience',\r\n              ]\r\n            },\r\n          ],\r\n          examples:\r\n          [\r\n            'Writing pauses',\r\n            'Practice presentations',\r\n            '“Remote Buttons” in a discussion section',\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          name: \"turns\",\r\n          what: 'In games, turns denote meaningful units of time that aren’t measured in clock time.

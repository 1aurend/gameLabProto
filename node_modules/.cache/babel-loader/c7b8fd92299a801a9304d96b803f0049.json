Thus, actions are the verbs of games, and which verbs are available to players determines not only how much variety there will be in gameplay and how many strategies will emerge, but also how complex the game is to learn. A game with too many or too few actions, or actions that don't combine well together risks becoming boring or tedious.\",\n  moves: [{\n    name: 'coming soon!'\n  }]\n}];\nexport default
